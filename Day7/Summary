2. Method Overriding occurs when a child class provides its own implementation of a parent class method.

3. A Constructor is a special method that runs automatically when an object is created and is used to initialize values.

4. The this keyword refers to the current object and is used to access its properties and methods.

5. Encapsulation protects data by making variables private and allowing access only through public methods.

6. Abstraction hides internal implementation details and shows only essential functionality to the user.

7. Using OOP concepts makes JavaScript code structured, reusable, secure, and easy to maintain.
